                        Before the battle began, Harold chose a defensive position on a hill. Harold probably had 
                        between 8,000 to 10,000 men and William had 7,500 to 8,000. (Poss 80).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, William attempted to attack Harold's defensive position with archers, hoping
                        to draw the English off of their position. The archers fired at the shield-wall the 
                        English had formed, but were unable to do much against them. (Poss 83).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        William then sent the infantry to fight shield-wall. Poss said about the infantry clashing with
                        the English shield-wall, "The fight was a familiar one to the English, and one they had long ago 
                        mastered" (84). The Norman army was close to breaking, so William ordered his calvary to attack
                        in a desperation move.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Normally, William would utilize the calvary after the infantry had weakened the enemy's resolve to
                        finish off the remaining resistance. William had to order them in early as the infantry were failing 
                        to make a dent in the English line (Poss 85). This proved to be a poor choice as the infantry had no where
                        to go as the calvary pushed up against them.

                        Up to this point in the battle, the English were very successful due to the <em>huscarls</em>. The 
                        <em>huscarls</em> were well-trained warriors who were a mixture of the <em>thegn</em> and hearth-companion.
                        <em>Thegns</em> held land and hearth-companions acted as personal bodyguards to the king. This formidable fighting
                        force was the backbone of the English army (Poss)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Poss explained the overall situation the Norman army faced by writing, "The infantry, as it tried to make way for the
                        charge, could find no exit and became disorganized, streaming downhill in no semblance of order. And the knights
                        could only watch with growing horror as the <em>huscarls</em>, with their axes, took them and their horses apart"
                        (88-89).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Normans, hearing a rumor of William's death, started to retreat. William siezed control of the situation and
                        led his troops to pick off the Englishmen who followed. While the first retreat was real, there were a few more instances
                        of this retreating then doubling back on the soldiers who followed. These feigned retreats were successful at weakening the 
                        English line, but it was not what defeated the English (Poss 90).

                        Harold was struck in the eye by an archer. While this did not outright kill him, his army began to break after seeing their 
                        leader fall. This allowed the Norman calvary to break through and kill Harold. In <cite>World Monarchies and Dynasties</cite>,
                        Harold's final moments were described as "Half-blind, Harold staggered through the enemy lines and was hacked to pieces by Norman swords"
                        (World Monarchies 376).

                        The battle had been all but lost for the English. Much like the vikings in the Battle of Stamford Bridge, the <em>huscarls</em>
                        fought to the death to avenge their fallen king (Poss 99).
