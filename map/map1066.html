                    <p>
                        The invasion of England was a multi-front invasion by King Harald of Norway and Duke William
                        of Normandy. The map to the left shows the distances marched by Harold to defend all of England.

                    <p>
                        Tostig raided the North of England to find troops and allies to his cause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tostig combined forces with King Harald of Norway. The English led by Edwin, Earl of Mercia and 
                        Morcar, Earl of Northumbria engaged Harald's forces at Fulford Gate. The English were routed by the
                        Norweigans. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        King Harold of England suprised King Harald and Tostig at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, defeating
                        the Norweigan army and killing both Harald and Tostig. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        King Harold marched from Stamford Bridge to confront William of Normandy in Southern England in Hastings. 
                        The Battle of Hastings becomes Harold's last stand as his weary forces were overwhelmed by the Normans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having killed and defeated King Harold in battle, Duke William was crowned King of England.
                    </p>
                    <h2 style="text-align:center">Aftermath</h2>
                    <p>William ruled until his death in 1087. He had to defend his kingdom from revolts by Edwin and Morcar. By 1071,
                        England was completely conquered by William.
                    </p>
                    <p>England was fundamentally changed culturally when William became King of England. The language
                        of government was changed from English to Latin. Latin and French replaced English as the language
                        of law (Bennett). The English language also shifted more to have a romance language influence from 
                        French and Latin in higher use.
