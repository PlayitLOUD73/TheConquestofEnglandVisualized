                    <p>
                        The invasion of England was a multi-front invasion by King Harald of Norway and Duke William
                        of Normandy. The map to the left shows the distances marched by Harold to defend all of England.

                    <p>
                        Tostig combines forces with King Harald of Norway. The English led by Edwin, Earl of Mercia and 
                        Morcar, Earl of Northumbria engage Harald's forces at Fulford Gate. The English were routed by the
                        Norweigans.

                        King Harold of England surpises King Harald and Tostig at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, defeating
                        the Norweigan army and killing both Harald and Tostig. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        King Harold marches from Stamford Bridge to confront Duke William in Southern England in Hastings. 
                        The Battle of Hastings becomes Harold's last stand as his weary forces are overwhelmed by the Normans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having killed and defeated King Harold in battle, Duke William was crowned King of England.
