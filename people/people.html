                <h3>William, Duke of Normandy</h3>
                <h3>Harald Hardrada, King of Norway</h3>
                    Harald Hardrada (or the "the Hard Ruler") became King of Norway in 1047. He had a
                    claim to the English throne and invaded Northern England. He and Tostig routed the
                    English at Fulford. At the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harald and his men were suprised
                    by the English army. Manley wrote in "Last of the Vikings", "When Hardrada...
                    took an arrow to the throat, the balance tipped in favor of the English" (Manley).

                <h3>Tostig Godwinson, former Earl of Northumbria</h3>
                <p>Tostig was Harold's brother, and he laid his own claim to the
                    English throne. He was expelled by Northumbria in 1065, and Morcar
                    replaced him (Bennett 24). Tostig raided Northern England and later joined forces 
                    with King Harald. He was killed in the Battle of Stamford Bridge.
