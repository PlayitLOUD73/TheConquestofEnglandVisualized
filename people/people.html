                <h3>King Harald Hardrada of Norway</h3>
                <h3>Tostig, former Earl of Northumbria</h3>
                <p>Tostig was Harold's brother, and he laid his own claim to the
                    English throne. He was expelled by Northumbria in 1065, and Morcar
                    replaced him (Bennett 24). Tostig raided Northern England and later joined forces 
                    with King Harald. He was killed in the Battle of Stamford Bridge.
