                <h3>Harold Godwinson, King of England</h3>
                <h3>William, Duke of Normandy</h3>
                <p>William became the Duke of Normandy at the age of 7. In the year 1064, Harold swore an oath
                    to William (the subject of the oath is debated). When Harold was crowned King of England,
                    William was able to claim rights to the throne based on Harold's slight agains him.
                    Freeman wrote in <cite>William the Conqueror</cite>, "... the wrong done by Harold to William
                    gave William a casus belli against Harold, and that William, if victorious. might claim the crown
                    of England... ...by right of conquest" (Chapter VI). 
                </p>
                <p>William invaded England and fought Harold
                    in the Battle of Hastings, defeating the English and taking Harold's life. William became known as
                    William the Conqueror, and he spent the rest of his days solidifying his rule over England (Chapter IX).</p>
                <h3>Harald Hardrada, King of Norway</h3>
                <p>Harald Hardrada (or the "the Hard Ruler") became King of Norway in 1047. He had a
                    claim to the English throne and invaded Northern England. He and Tostig routed the
                    English at Fulford. At the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harald and his men were suprised
                    by the English army. Manley wrote in "Last of the Vikings", "When Hardrada...
                    took an arrow to the throat, the balance tipped in favor of the English" (Manley).

                <h3>Tostig Godwinson, former Earl of Northumbria</h3>
                <p>Tostig was Harold's brother, and he laid his own claim to the
                    English throne. He was expelled by Northumbria in 1065, and Morcar
                    replaced him (Bennett 24). Tostig raided Northern England and later joined forces 
                    with King Harald. He was killed in the Battle of Stamford Bridge.
